  <h1>Omni-V2X: A Vision-Language Model for Actionable Insights in Vehicle-to-Everything Systems</h1>
  <p>
    Cooperative perception in autonomous driving enhances situational awareness by sharing multi-modal sensor data through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, challenges like bandwidth limitations, computational constraints, and data heterogeneity hinder its adoption. This paper presents Omni-V2X, a vision-language framework that generates real-time, actionable scene descriptions by fusing multi-view images and driving context. Omni-V2X employs a spatially-aware cross-view attention mechanism and parameter-efficient processing, enabling deployment on in-vehicle edge computing units. It shares concise insights for navigation and decision-making, such as object detection and obstacle awareness. Experimental results on the DAIR-V2X-C dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with ROUGE 55.3, BLEU 42.8, and AP 72.4, while maintaining low latency. The modular design ensures scalability and future integration with LiDAR and other modalities. This work advances robust, scalable, and context-aware cooperative perception for autonomous driving.

Traditional methods (see following figure) focus on single-frame onboard feature fusion for object detection or tracking, limiting their interpretability. In contrast, Omni-V2X incorporates cooperative features from multiple perspectives alongside driving context, enabling interpretable and actionable insights through a vision-language model while maintaining object detection capabilities.

## üìÇ Data Downloading
We use the DAIR-V2X dataset, a benchmark for collaborative perception in autonomous driving. As shown in Figure 3, the dataset provides RGB images, LiDAR point clouds, and calibration files to enable accurate projection between coordinate systems. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes for vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and other objects in urban
traffic environments, such as intersections and multi-lane roads. For more details, explore the [DAIR-V2X dataset here](https://thudair.baai.ac.cn/login).
